# Community-API
https://community.hafven.de

Hafven Community Projects should have the possibility to access information of the Hafven.

## Description
- Middle which is independent from Cobot
- Possibility to integrate multiple data sources

## Communication Flow
AWS Api Gateway -> Community Hafven -> Cobot

## ToDos
- Add CircleCi further tests
- Access rights to AWS and Cloud Functions
- Understand AWS API Gateway / OAUTH Flow
- Build OAUTH into Community Hafven
- more commits

## Using the Hafven API

### oAuth2-flow using your Hafven App credentials

Start the oauth flow by sending your user to the following domain passing your app's client parameters. `redirect_uri` must match your app's registered domain and has to use https.
```
https://community.hafven.de/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=<your client id>&redirect_uri=<your apps callback url>&scope=<required scope>&state=<optional parameter that gets passed back to your redirect_uri>
```
The users will be asked to log in and approve your app using their Hafven Login credentials. After that users are redirected back to your app, using the `redirect_uri` parameter you provided in your initial request. A parameter called `code` will be added to the URL. You have to extract this information to for the next step. If you provided a state parameter it will be added as well.

In the final step you need to acquire an access token by sending a `POST` request to `https://community.hafven.de/oauth/access_token`. The request body should look like this: `client_id=<your client id>&client_secret=<your secret>&grant_type=authorization_code&code=<the code from the previous step>`

### Hafven Community API
You can make requests to recieve the users information using the provided token in your Authorization Header:
```
Authorization: Bearer <your token>
```
All endpoints are to be reached under the url `https://community.hafven.de/api/`

#### GET /user

GET request to `https://community.hafven.de/api/user` returns the user's name and email:
```
{
  "full_name": "users full name",
   "email": "users email adress"
}

```

## Getting Started
